## Use Generated FBX Models

### Download

Go visit our [project page](https://hongfz16.github.io/projects/AvatarCLIP.html). Go to the section 'Avatar Gallery'. Pick a model you like. Click 'Load Model' below. Click 'Download FBX' link at the bottom of the pop-up viewer.

<img src='./assets/download_fbx.jpg' width='60%'>

### Import to Your Favourite 3D Software (e.g. Blender, Unity3D)

The FBX models are already rigged. Use your motion library to animate it!

<img src='./assets/blender_motion.gif' width='100%'>

### Upload to Mixamo

To make use of the rich motion library provided by [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com), you can also upload the FBX model to Mixamo. The rigging process is completely automatic!

<img src='./assets/mixamo_motion.gif' width='100%'>

## Installation

We recommend using anaconda to manage the python environment. The setup commands below are provided for your reference.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hongfz16/AvatarCLIP.git
cd AvatarCLIP
conda create -n AvatarCLIP python=3.7
conda activate AvatarCLIP
conda install pytorch==1.7.0 torchvision==0.8.0 torchaudio==0.7.0 cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Other than the above steps, you should also install [neural_renderer](https://github.com/daniilidis-group/neural_renderer) following its instructions. Before compiling neural_renderer (or after compiling should also be fine), remember to add the following three lines to `neural_renderer/perspective.py` after line 19.

```python
x[z<=0] = 0
y[z<=0] = 0
z[z<=0] = 0
```

This quick fix is for a rendering issue where objects behide the camera will also be rendered. Be careful when using this fixed version of neural_renderer on your other projects, because this fix will cause the rendering process not differentiable.

To support offscreen rendering for motion visualization, you should install osmesa library.

```bash
conda install -c menpo osmesa
```

## Data Preparation

### Download SMPL Models
Register and download SMPL models [here](https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/). Put the downloaded models in the folder `smpl_models`. The folder structure should look like

```
./
├── ...
└── smpl_models/
    ├── smpl/
        ├── SMPL_FEMALE.pkl
        ├── SMPL_MALE.pkl
        └── SMPL_NEUTRAL.pkl
```

### Download Pretrained Models & Other Data
This download is only for coarse shape generation and motion generation. You can skip if you only want to use other parts. Download the pretrained weights and other required data [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjLpFg-f48ljgZl9qpU7_6ZA9B7qwA?e=pPcHIG). Put them in the folder `AvatarGen` so that the folder structure should look like

```
./
├── ...
└── AvatarGen/
    └── ShapeGen/
        └── data/
            ├── codebook.pth
            ├── model_VAE_16.pth
            ├── nongrey_male_0110.jpg
            ├── smpl_uv.mtl
            └── smpl_uv.obj
```


Pretrained weights and human texture for motion generation can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TSyeT8MwH5EVQRbNGRVkWsA4Y9Y6dRbk?usp=sharing). Note that the human texture we used to render poses is from [SURREAL dataset](https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/surreal/data/). Besides, you should download pretrained weights of [VPoser v2.0](https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de/download.php). Put them in the folder `AvatarAnimate` so that the folder structure should look like

```
├── ...
└── AvatarAnimate/
    └── data/

                └── V02_05_epoch=13_val_loss=0.03.ckpt
        
```

## Avatar Generation

### Coarse Shape Generation

Folder `AvatarGen/ShapeGen` contains codes for this part. Run the follow command to generate the coarse shape corresponding to the shape description 'a strong man'. We recommend to use the prompt augmentation 'a 3d rendering of xxx in unreal engine' for better results. The generated coarse body mesh will be stored under `AvatarGen/ShapeGen/output/coarse_shape`.

```bash
python main.py --target_txt 'a 3d rendering of a strong man in unreal engine'
```

Then we need to render the mesh for initialization of the implicit avatar representation. Use the following command for rendering.

```bash
python render.py --coarse_shape_obj output/coarse_shape/a_3d_rendering_of_a_strong_man_in_unreal_engine.obj --output_folder ${RENDER_FOLDER}
```

### Shape Sculpting and Texture Generation

Note that all the codes are tested on NVIDIA V100 (32GB memory). Therefore, in order to run on GPUs with lower memory, please try to scale down the network or tune down `max_ray_num` in the config files. You can refer to `confs/examples_small/example.conf` or our [colab demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dfaecX7xF3nP6fyXc8XBljV5QY1lc1TR?usp=sharing) for a scale-down version of AvatarCLIP.

Folder `AvatarGen/AppearanceGen` contains codes for this part. We provide data, pretrained model and scripts to perform shape sculpting and texture generation on a zero-beta body (mean shape defined by SMPL). We provide many example scripts under `AvatarGen/AppearanceGen/confs/examples`. For example, if we want to generate 'Abraham Lincoln', which is defined in the config file `confs/examples/abrahamlincoln.conf`, use the following command.

```bash
python main.py --mode train_clip --conf confs/examples/abrahamlincoln.conf
```

Results will be stored in `AvatarCLIP/AvatarGen/AppearanceGen/exp/smpl/examples/abrahamlincoln`.

If you wish to perform shape sculpting and texture generation on the previously generated coarse shape. We also provide example config files in `confs/base_models/astrongman.conf` `confs/astrongman/*.conf`. Two steps of optimization are required as follows.

```bash
# Initilization of the implicit avatar
python main.py --mode train --conf confs/base_models/astrongman.conf
# Shape sculpting and texture generation on the initialized implicit avatar
python main.py --mode train_clip --conf confs/astrongman/hulk.conf
```

### Marching Cube

To extract meshes from the generated implicit avatar, one may use the following command.

```bash
python main.py --mode validate_mesh --conf confs/examples/abrahamlincoln.conf
```

The final high resolution mesh will be stored as `AvatarCLIP/AvatarGen/AppearanceGen/exp/smpl/examples/abrahamlincoln/meshes/00030000.ply`

## Convert Avatar to FBX Format

For the convenience of using the generated avatar with modern graphics pipeline, we also provide scripts to rig the avatar and convert to FBX format. See the instructions [here](./Avatar2FBX/README.md).


## Motion Generation

### Candidate Poses Generation

Here we provide four different methods for pose generation.

1. PoseOptimizer: directly optimize on SMPL theta

2. VPoserOptimizer: optimize the latent space of VPoser

3. VPoserRealNVP: get latent codes of VPoser from pretrained conditional RealNVP

4. VPoserCodebook: select the most similar poses to the given text feature


We provide configurations to compare these methods. Here are some examples:

```bash
# Suppose your current location is `AvatarCLIP/AvatarAnimate`

# Use PoseOptimizer method to generate poses for "arguing"
python main.py --conf confs/pose_ablation/pose_optimizer/argue.conf
# Results are stored in `AvatarCLIP/AvatarAnimate/exp/pose_ablation/pose_optimizer/argue` directory
# candidate_0.jpg, candidate_1.jpg, ..., candidate_4.jpg are the top-5 poses
# candidate_0.npy, candidate_1.npy, ..., candidate_4.npy are corresponding parameters

# Use VPoserOptimizer method to generate poses for "praying"
python main.py --conf confs/pose_ablation/vposer_optimizer/pray.conf
# Results are stored in `AvatarCLIP/AvatarAnimate/exp/pose_ablation/vposer_optimizer/pray` directory

# Use VPoserRealNVP method to generate poses for "shooting a basketball"
python main.py --conf confs/pose_ablation/vposer_realnvp/shoot_basketball.conf
# Results are stored in `AvatarCLIP/AvatarAnimate/exp/pose_ablation/vposer_realnvp/shoot_basketball` directory

# Use VPoserCodebook method to generate poses for "running"
python main.py --conf confs/pose_ablation/vposer_codebook/run.conf
# Results are stored in `AvatarCLIP/AvatarAnimate/exp/pose_ablation/vposer_codebook/run` directory
```

### Motion Generation

Here we provide three different methods for motion generation.

1. MotionInterpolation: directly interpolate between given poses

2. MotionOptimizer (baseline): optimize latent code of a pretrained VAE with a simple reconstruction loss

3. MotionOptimizer (ours): optimize latent code of a pretrained VAE with weighted reconstruction loss, delta loss, and clip loss



We provide configurations to compare these methods. Here are some examples:

```bash
# Suppose your current location is `AvatarCLIP/AvatarAnimate`

# Use MotionInterpolation method to generate motion for "arguing"
python main.py --conf confs/motion_ablation/interpolation/argue.conf
# Results are stored in `AvatarCLIP/AvatarAnimate/exp/motion_ablation/interpolation/argue` directory
# candidate_0.jpg, candidate_1.jpg, ..., candidate_4.jpg are the top-5 poses
# candidate_0.npy, candidate_1.npy, ..., candidate_4.npy are corresponding parameters
# motion.mp4 is the generated motion
# motion.npy is corresponding parameters

# Use MotionOptimizer (baseline) method to generate motion for "praying"
python main.py --conf confs/motion_ablation/baseline/pray.conf
# Results are stored in `AvatarCLIP/AvatarAnimate/exp/motion_ablation/baseline/pray` directory

# Use MotionOptimizer (ours) method to generate motion for "shooting a basketball"
python main.py --conf confs/motion_ablation/motion_optimizer/shoot_basketball.conf
# Results are stored in `AvatarCLIP/AvatarAnimate/exp/motion_ablation/motion_optimizer/shoot_basketball` directory
```

### Make your own configure

Each configuration contains three independent parts: general setting, pose generator, and motion generator.

```text
# General Setting
general {
    # describe the results path
    base_exp_dir = ./exp/motion_ablation/motion_optimizer/raise_arms

    # if you only want to generate poses, then you can set "mode = pose".
    mode = motion

    # define your prompt. We highly recommend using the format "a rendered 3d man is xxx"
    text = a rendered 3d man is raising both arms
}

# Pose Generator
pose_generator {
    type = VPoserCodebook
    # you can change the number of candidate poses by setting "topk = 10"
    # for PoseOptimizer and VPoserOptimizer, you can further define the number of iterations and the optimizer type
}

# Motion Generator
# if "mode = pose", you can ignore this part
motion_generator {
    type = MotionOptimizer
    # you can further modify the coefficient of each loss. 
    # for example, if you find the generated motion is very intensive, you can reduce the coefficient of delta loss.
}


```
